## Description

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

These examples provide a foundation for understanding the semantics behind vector embeddings and the basics behind writing LLM based applications to allow people to interact with your own content. Each example builds on the next, providing you a strong understanding of how LLM based AI applications work.

You will find in the source code file for each example notes to help you understand the example and how to run it.

The makefile has everything you need to get up and running quickly.

### Installing Software

To run the examples in this repo, start by installing `mongosh` and `ollama` using Brew. If you don't have Brew installed, I highly recommend it.

```
make install
```

Next you want to pull down these images:
- `mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local`
- `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.6.18`
- `postgres:17.5`

Run the following command to do so:
```
make docker
```

With the software installed, you will want to start your Ollama service. Open a terminal and run the following command. This will show logs so start a terminal window you can see but won't need.

```
make ollama-up
```

Now start the Mongo and Open Web containers in Docker Compose. Open a new terminal window for this.

```
make compose-up
```

Now you need to pull down the models you will be using. Open a new terminal window for this. This might take several minutes depending on your bandwidth.

```
make ollama-pull
```

## Our Experience

We have taught Go to thousands of developers all around the world since 2014. There is no other company that has been doing it longer and our material has proven to help jump-start developers 6 to 12 months ahead of their knowledge of Go. We know what knowledge developers need in order to be productive and efficient when writing software in Go.

Our classes are perfect for intermediate-level developers who have at least a few months to years of experience writing code in Go. Our classes provide a very deep knowledge of the programming langauge with a big push on language mechanics, design philosophies and guidelines. We focus on teaching how to write code with a priority on consistency, integrity, readability and simplicity. We cover a lot about “if performance matters” with a focus on mechanical sympathy, data oriented design, decoupling and writing/debugging production software.

## More About Go

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has a unique and simple nature that make Go programs different in character from programs written in other languages. It balances the capabilities of a low-level systems language with some high-level features you see in modern languages today. This creates a programming environment that allows you to be incredibly productive, performant and fully in control; in Go, you can write less code and do so much more.

Go is the fusion of performance and productivity wrapped in a language that software developers can learn, use and understand. Go is not C, yet we have many of the benefits of C with the benefits of higher level programming languages.
